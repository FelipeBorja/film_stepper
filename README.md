# film_stepper
This is the Arduino code for running the stepper motor that is part of the horizontal surge mechanism of the test apparatus for the FILM (Flow Imaging Lab @ Mudd) group.

Note: Due to the usage of an I2C LCD screen, a separate library for controlling such an LCD is required. You can download the necessary library by following the instructions [at this link](https://bitbucket.org/fmalpartida/new-liquidcrystal/wiki/Home). They are under the "Downloading and Installation" section. This library is necessary for the code to be compiled.
